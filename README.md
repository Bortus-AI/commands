# Claude Code Slash Commands Collection

A comprehensive collection of production-ready slash commands for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), designed to accelerate software development workflows through intelligent automation and agent orchestration.

## Overview

This repository contains 52 specialized slash commands that extend Claude Code's capabilities. Commands are organized into **workflows** (smart agent orchestration) and **tools** (single-purpose utilities) to provide comprehensive development automation.

### ü§ù Works with Claude Code Subagents

These commands are designed to work seamlessly with the [Claude Code Subagents collection](https://github.com/wshobson/agents). Many workflow commands orchestrate multiple specialized subagents to handle complex, multi-domain tasks. For the best experience, use both repositories together.

## Installation

These commands are automatically available when placed in `~/.claude/commands/` directory.

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/commands.git
```

### üì¶ Complete Setup (Recommended)

For full functionality with subagent orchestration, also install the subagents collection:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/agents.git
```

The agent-orchestrated workflows and multi-agent tools in this collection rely on the specialized subagents from the [subagents repository](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) for their enhanced capabilities.

## Available Commands

The collection is organized into:

- **ü§ñ Workflows** (`/workflows/`): Smart agent orchestration commands that coordinate multiple specialized subagents to complete complex, multi-step tasks
- **üîß Tools** (`/tools/`): Single-purpose commands for specific development tasks with comprehensive implementations

## Usage

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code will automatically suggest appropriate commands based on the task context and requirements.

### Explicit Invocation
Run any command directly by typing the command name:
```
/api-scaffold user management with authentication

## When to Use Agent Commands vs Specialized Tools

### üîÄ Agent-Based Commands (Workflows & Multi-Agent Tools)
Use these when you need:
- **Problem-solving**: Agents analyze and solve issues (e.g., `/smart-debug`, `/multi-agent-optimize`)
- **Multiple perspectives**: Coordinated review from different specialists (e.g., `/multi-agent-review`)
- **Complex orchestration**: Multi-step processes requiring different expertise (e.g., `/full-stack-feature`)
- **Adaptive solutions**: When the approach needs to be determined based on the problem

### üõ†Ô∏è Specialized Tools
Use these when you need:
- **Infrastructure setup**: Configure debugging, monitoring, or testing environments (e.g., `/debug-trace`, `/monitor-setup`)
- **Code generation**: Create specific implementations or configurations (e.g., `/api-scaffold`, `/k8s-manifest`)
- **Analysis without fixes**: Understand patterns or generate reports (e.g., `/error-analysis`, `/tech-debt`)
- **Domain-specific tasks**: Highly specialized operations (e.g., `/ai-review` for ML code, `/langchain-agent` for LangChain)

### üìã Key Differences
- **Agent commands** solve problems by analyzing and implementing fixes
- **Setup tools** create infrastructure and configurations
- **Agent commands** adapt their approach based on the issue
- **Specialized tools** follow predefined patterns and templates

## When to Use Workflows vs Tools

### ü§ñ Use Workflows When:
- **Multi-domain coordination needed** - Feature touches backend, frontend, and infrastructure
- **Complex agent orchestration required** - Need multiple specialists working together
- **End-to-end implementation desired** - Want complete feature from design to deployment
- **Uncertain about approach** - Let agents determine best implementation strategy
- **Time constraints** - Need rapid, comprehensive implementation

**Examples:**
- "Implement user authentication system" ‚Üí `/feature-development`
- "Fix performance issues across the stack" ‚Üí `/smart-fix`
- "Modernize legacy monolith" ‚Üí `/legacy-modernize`

### üîß Use Tools When:
- **Specific expertise needed** - Clear, focused task in one domain
- **Precise control desired** - Want to direct specific implementation details
- **Part of manual workflow** - Integrating into existing processes
- **Deep specialization required** - Need expert-level implementation
- **Building on existing work** - Enhancing or refining previous outputs

**Examples:**
- "Create Kubernetes manifests" ‚Üí `/k8s-manifest`
- "Scan for security vulnerabilities" ‚Üí `/security-scan`
- "Generate API documentation" ‚Üí `/doc-generate`

## Command Format

Each command follows this structure:
```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: Brief description of what the command does
---

Detailed command implementation with:
- Framework detection and intelligent selection
- Complete, production-ready code
- Security best practices
- Cross-command integration points
```

## Best Practices

### üéØ Command Selection
1. **Let Claude Code suggest automatically** - The main agent analyzes context and selects optimal commands
2. **Start with workflows for complex tasks** - Let agents coordinate multi-domain implementations
3. **Use tools for focused expertise** - Apply specific commands for targeted improvements
4. **Consider command dependencies** - Some tools work better after specific workflows

### üìù Request Optimization  
5. **Provide comprehensive context** - Include tech stack, constraints, existing patterns, and quality requirements
6. **Be specific about integration points** - Mention how outputs should connect to existing systems
7. **Specify success criteria** - Define what "done" looks like for your use case
8. **Include examples when helpful** - Show desired output format or similar implementations

### üîÑ Workflow Management
9. **Combine commands strategically** - Chain related commands for complete solutions
10. **Use iterative refinement** - Start broad with workflows, then narrow with tools
11. **Leverage cross-command integration** - Commands are designed to work together seamlessly
12. **Monitor progress and provide feedback** - Guide agents with clarifications and corrections

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
13. **Batch related operations** - Combine similar commands to reduce context switching
14. **Reuse command outputs** - Build on previous results rather than starting fresh
15. **Choose appropriate command scope** - Match complexity to command capabilities

## Contributing

To add a new command:
1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate directory (`workflows/` or `tools/`)
2. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names
3. Follow the command format structure above
4. Include comprehensive implementation details
5. Write clear descriptions for when the command should be used
6. Use the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found or not working:**
- Ensure commands are in `~/.claude/commands/` directory
- Check command file syntax and format
- Verify the command name matches the file name

**Unexpected output or behavior:**
- Provide more context about your project and tech stack
- Be specific about requirements and constraints
- Try breaking complex requests into smaller commands

**Workflow commands taking too long:**
- This is normal - workflows coordinate multiple agents
- Consider using specific tools for faster, focused results
- Monitor progress and provide feedback to guide agents

**Tools producing generic outputs:**
- Include framework/language-specific details in your request
- Mention existing patterns or preferences in your codebase
- Provide examples of desired output format

**Cross-command integration issues:**
- Check that file paths and naming conventions align
- Ensure commands are run in the correct sequence
- Verify that dependencies between commands are met

### Getting Help

If commands aren't working as expected:
1. Check individual command documentation for specific requirements
2. Try simpler, more focused requests first
3. Provide more context about your project structure and goals
4. Use explicit tool invocation to test specific functionality

## Performance Optimization

### üéØ Efficient Usage Patterns

**Command Selection Strategy:**
- **Workflows**: Multi-agent coordination, end-to-end implementation
- **Tools**: Focused, single-domain tasks
- **Simple requests**: Stay with main agent for basic operations

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Start simple**: Try tools before workflows for known problems
2. **Batch operations**: Combine multiple related requests
3. **Reuse context**: Build on previous command outputs
4. **Early termination**: Stop and adjust if commands aren't producing expected results

### ‚ö° Performance Tips

**Faster Command Execution:**
- Use specific tools for focused tasks rather than broad workflows
- Provide clear, detailed requirements upfront to avoid iterations
- Reference existing code patterns and preferences
- Choose commands that match your exact use case

**Efficient Workflows:**
- Let workflows complete before requesting modifications
- Provide comprehensive context in initial request
- Use cross-command integration rather than isolated commands
- Monitor agent progress and provide real-time feedback

### Adding a New Workflow:
- Focus on agent orchestration and delegation logic
- Specify which specialized agents to use and in what order
- Define coordination patterns between agents

### Adding a New Tool:
- Include complete, production-ready implementations
- Structure content with clear sections and actionable outputs
- Include examples, best practices, and integration points
