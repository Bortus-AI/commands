# Claude Code Slash Commands

A collection of production-ready slash commands for Claude Code to accelerate software development workflows. Commands are organized into two categories: **workflows** (smart agent orchestration) and **tools** (single-purpose utilities).

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local `.claude` directory for easy access:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/commands.git
```

This will make all slash commands available to Claude Code in any project.

## Overview

These commands leverage Claude Code's specialized agent system to provide intelligent automation for complex development tasks. The collection is organized into:

- **ðŸ¤– Workflows** (`/workflows/`): Smart agent orchestration commands that coordinate multiple specialized subagents to complete complex, multi-step tasks

## When to Use Workflows vs Tools

### Use Workflows When:

- You need multiple specialized agents working together
- The task requires coordination across different domains
- You want intelligent task delegation and orchestration
- The problem is complex and benefits from diverse expertise
- You need end-to-end implementation of a feature

### Use Tools When:

- You have a specific, well-defined task
- You need deep expertise in a single domain
- You want direct control over the implementation
- The task is part of a larger manual workflow
- You need to customize or iterate on specific aspects

## Best Practices

1. **Start with workflows** for complex tasks - Let agents coordinate the implementation
2. **Use tools for refinement** - Apply specific tools to enhance workflow outputs
3. **Provide context** - Include tech stack, constraints, and requirements
4. **Leverage agent expertise** - Trust specialized agents with their domains
5. **Combine approaches** - Use workflows for implementation, tools for optimization

## Contributing

### Adding a New Workflow:

1. Create a markdown file in the `workflows/` directory
2. Define the agent orchestration sequence
3. Specify which specialized agents to use and in what order
4. Use the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input
5. Focus on coordination and delegation logic

### Adding a New Tool:

1. Create a markdown file in the `tools/` directory
2. Include comprehensive implementation details
3. Use the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input
4. Structure content with clear sections and actionable outputs
5. Include examples, best practices, and integration points
