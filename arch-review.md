# Architecture Review and Analysis

Perform a comprehensive architecture review of: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze and provide recommendations for:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - Map existing components and dependencies
   - Identify architectural patterns in use
   - Document data flows
   - Assess technology stack

2. **SOLID Principles Compliance**:
   - Single Responsibility violations
   - Open/Closed principle adherence
   - Liskov Substitution issues
   - Interface Segregation opportunities
   - Dependency Inversion improvements

3. **Scalability Assessment**:
   - Horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Database bottlenecks
   - Caching opportunities
   - Message queue integration points
   - Load balancing requirements

4. **Security Architecture**:
   - Authentication/authorization flow
   - Data encryption at rest/transit
   - Secret management
   - API security
   - OWASP compliance

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - N+1 query problems
   - Inefficient algorithms
   - Memory leaks
   - Connection pooling
   - Async/await opportunities

6. **Technical Debt**:
   - Code duplication
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Missing abstractions
   - Testing gaps
   - Documentation needs

7. **Modernization Roadmap**:
   - Microservices opportunities
   - Containerization strategy
   - Cloud-native patterns
   - Event-driven architecture
   - API gateway implementation

Provide specific, actionable recommendations with code examples. Prioritize changes by impact and effort. Include migration strategies for major changes.
